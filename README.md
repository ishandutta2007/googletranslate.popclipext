# Google Translate(PopClipExtension)
[中文说明](https://github.com/wizyoung/googletranslate.popclipext/blob/master/README_CN.md)

**NOTE**: Since version 3.0, the Python interpreter is switched from Python2 to Python3. If you don't have Python3 installed in your system, please install it yourself.

An unofficial free Google translate PopClip Extension based on [Googletrans Python API](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans).

## Preview

- English to Chinese (Simplified):
  
<div align=center><img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://github.com/wizyoung/googletranslate.popclipext/blob/master/screenshots/en2cn.gif?raw=true"/></div>

<div align=center><img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://github.com/wizyoung/googletranslate.popclipext/blob/master/screenshots/cn2en.gif?raw=true"/></div>

  Click `Copy` to copy the translated results.

## Settings

- `Google Translate Site`: Choosing from `translate.google.cn` (default) or `translate.google.com`. The `.cn` server is for users in mainland China where the `.com` server is blocked by the government. 
- `Destination Language` and `Source Language`: If the selected text is not the `Source Language`, the sentences will be translated to the `Source Language`. Otherwise, the  sentences will be translated to the `Destination Language`.

You can change all these settings by clicking the pencil shaped icon at the bottom of the popclip drop-down list.

## Install

Download the file from [Releases](https://github.com/wizyoung/googletranslate.popclipext/releases) and double click to install the extension.

The auto update alert feature is new to version 2.1, so the extension will check for updates once every seven days.

## Frequently asked questions

- Sometimes the pop-up window of PopClip just doesn't show up when I select some sentences.

It's the bug of PopClip. You can manually  trigger PopClip window to appear by AppleScript: `tell application "PopClip" to appear`. And I'm using BetterTouchTool to achieve this function by binding `3 Finger Swipe Up` gesture to run this AppleScript.
